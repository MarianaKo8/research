Our research combines first-principles calculations and scale-bridging simulations with the main aim to link molecular structure with material's properties. We work with different types of molecules and macromolecules, and examine their diverse advance functionalities steered by chemical composition, intermolecular interactions and assembly processes. The description of the key research topics is provided in Research.  

Virtual Design of Soft Matter and Natural Materials
======
My research group in Virtual Design of Soft Matter and Natural Materials was initiated in 2024 within [SynGen Center](https://www.syn-gen.de/en). We use scale-bridging computational methods to understand the dynamics and assembly of molecules, protein–DNA complexes, and sequence-controlled biomolecular assemblies. By leveraging a wide range of computational techniques and theory–experiment feedback loops, we aim to elucidate mechanistic insights that guide the engineering of nanoscale assemblies and hybrid programmable systems, ultimately enabling the design of new molecules and materials with desired encoded functions.

DNA Unit of VirtMat
======
The platform [DNA Unit of Virtual Materials Design](https://www.materials.kit.edu/1115.php) brings together interdisciplinary teams dedicated to developing virtual pipelines for the analysis and simulation of DNA and DNA-based materials. These pipelines support the design of functional DNA sequences, as well as the understanding of DNA organization, interactions with other molecules, and the development of novel DNA-containing materials for nanomaterial technologies. Our contribution focuses on coarse-grained simulations of protein–DNA systems in synthetic genomics, nucleosome interactions, enhanced sampling approaches, chromatin folding, and studies of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation.
