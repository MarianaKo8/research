title: "Structural dynamics in the CENP-A nucleosome impacted by protein-protein interactions with centromere protein N"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/preprint_NCP
excerpt: 'We demonstrate that CENP-N binding induces changes in the conformational ensemble of CENP-A histone proteins in noncanonical centromeres. We detect the enhanced fluctuations of the CENP-A N-terminal tail, suggesting that this region relies on interactions with specific binding partners for protein stabilization and regulation.'
